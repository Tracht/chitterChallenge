Technologies used
-------
* [React Single Page App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)
* I used the Create React App framework so that I can use it with any backend. It just creates a simple frontend build pipeline. 

Steps to run on your local
--------
* create a project directory in which to fork/clone this project's repo
* inside that directory, run the command ```npm install```
* to start the browser, run the command ```npm start```
* to run the tests, make sure the browser is open and then run the command ``` npx cypress open``` 
* open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser

Concepts
--------
* Frontend, single page web apps.
* Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).
* Ajax.
* Frontend templating.
* Frontend routing.
* Events and event handlers.
