This App is not finished!

Challenge
-------
Build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript.
[The API documentation is here](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend). 
The API supports the following interactions:
* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

Planning
-------
* [User stories](https://github.com/Tracht/chitterChallengeJavaScript/wiki/User-stories)
* [Diagramming]()

Technologies used
-------
* [React Single Page App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)
* I used the Create React App framework so that I can use it with any backend. It just creates a simple frontend build pipeline. 

Steps to run on your local
--------
* create a project directory in which to fork/clone this project's repo
* inside that directory, run the command ```npm install```
* to start the browser, run the command ```npm start```
* open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser

Concepts
--------
Frontend, single page web apps.
Events and event handlers.
Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).
